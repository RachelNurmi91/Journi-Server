## Project Summary
This acts as the server for the [Journi Travel Companion](https://github.com/RachelNurmi91/Journi) application. While traveling, I noticed confirmations and bookings get lost in emails and there are too many accounts to sign into to access travel information quickly. To combat that issue I created Journi, a fullstack application that allow users to store upcoming travel plans in a singuar place. Journi uses JavaScript and React JS with with MongoDB to store user data and travel plans as objects using the REST approach. The application communicates between the front end and back end to create, store and fetch travel plans so a user can seamlessly location their trips information in one place.

### Technologies
Journi relies on the following packages and libraries:
* [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en)
* [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com/)
* [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)
* [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon)
* [Passport](https://www.passportjs.org/)
