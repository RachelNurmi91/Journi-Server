## Project Summary
This acts as the server for the [Journi Travel Companion](https://github.com/RachelNurmi91/Journi) application. While traveling, I noticed confirmations and bookings get lost in emails, and there are too many accounts to sign into to access travel information quickly. To combat that issue, I created Journi, a Fullstack application that allows users to store upcoming travel plans in a single place. Journi uses JavaScript and React JS with MongoDB to store user data and travel plans as objects using the REST approach. The application communicates between the Front-End and Back-End to create, store, and fetch travel plans so a user can seamlessly locate their trip information in one place.


### Technologies
Journi relies on the following packages and libraries:
* [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en)
* [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com/)
* [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)
* [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon)
* [Passport](https://www.passportjs.org/)
